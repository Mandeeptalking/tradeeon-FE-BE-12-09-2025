## 🎯 The Bottom Line

### What Was Requested

> "When RSI goes below 30, it usually keeps falling. However, before going further up or further down, it mostly goes in a range, and that's where I want to buy. But sometimes it goes to below 30 but comes right back up - how do I not miss the chance?"

### What Was Delivered

**Complete RSI "Between" operator** that:
- ✅ Catches consolidation ranges
- ✅ Works with "crosses_above" for bounces
- ✅ Avoids bad entries
- ✅ Has full UI integration
- ✅ Has comprehensive documentation
